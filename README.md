# Introduction
Cover Fieldtree and Partition Fieldtree are designed for efficient storage of 2D spatial objects (such as rectangles, circles, ...).

Cover (loose) field tree is similar to MX-Quadtree or PR-Quadtree, where each node can have 4 children, and partition occurs at the center of the node. Unlike PR-Quadtree and MX-Quadtree, Cover Fieldtree accepts a `p_value` which is a floating point number between 0 and 1 (0 < `p_value` < 1). This value is being used to enlarge the nodes by (1 + `p_value`) times for better storage efficiency. `p_value` = 0 is known as MX-Quadtree.

In Partition Fieldtree, the children are created by shifting them by 1/2 their size both in X and Y direction. In this scenario each node can have 9 children and up to 4 parents (possible number of parents are 1 for center node, 2 for edge nodes, and 4 for corner nodes).This dependency causes more computation during adding children and merging them (upon delete), while give the most effiecient storage and find operations. 

New in 2.1.0:

Fixed implicit Using.

Removed constraints for default constructor when creating ISpatial derived classes.

New in 2.0.0:

Updated to be compatible with .Net 6.0.

Fixed the typo in Bottom up cover field tree.

New in 1.1.0:

Goodbye to fixed sizes: Added Bottom up Cover Field Tree. The bottom up cover field tree doesn't need to know a predefined root size. Initially when the tree is empty there is no node. As the first object is added to the tree, tree finds a square encapsulating node where the size is the first power of 2 greater than the object size. This node becomes the root. When another object is added which does not fit in the root node, the structure creates a parent of the old root, which becomes the new root node, and then creates all the children, i.e. siblings of the previous root node. This new design allows the tree to grow from bottom (children) and top (parent), which is ideal for scenarios where the size of the canvas is not predefined. 

To use this new structure use:

`BottomUpCoverFieldTree<Rect> fieldTree = new BottomUpCoverFieldTree<Rect>(p_value, [optional_node_capacity=2]);`

# Usage
The supported objects for storage in the data structure need to implement `ISpatial` interface:

  `using FieldTree2D_v2.Spatial;`
  
  `public class Rect : ISpatial {}`

When implementing `ISpatial` please note that currently Bounding Box supports only `int` for faster performance.

Then data structre can be initialized using

  `CoverFieldTree<Rect> coverFieldTree = new CoverFieldTree<Rect>(width, height, p_value);`
  
or

  `PartitionFieldTree<Rect> fieldTree = new PartitionFieldTree<Rect>(width, height);`
  
Objects can be added to the data structure using `Add` or `AddMany`. Objects can be removed using `Remove` or `PopNearestObject` where the latter finds the object closest to the specified query point and pops it. 

Point Query without deletion can be performed using `FindNearestObjects`. Note: if query point intersects with multiple objects (i.e. the distance to query point is zero) then all those objects are returned. Therefore the returned list can have 1 object (closet object) if query point does not intersect with any object, or >= 1 members for intersecting objects.

Range Query can be performed using `RangeQuery` for circular or rectangular regions.

To retrieve all object `All` can be used.

Both data structures support incremental nearest neighbor finidng. To use this feature, first initialize the query point using `InitIncrementalNearestNeighbor` and then find the next closest object by calling `IncrementalNearestNeighborFindNext`. This algorithm doesn't reset the search, therefore, it can be used to efficiently sort object based on closeness to the query point.

To reset the data structure `Clear` command can be used.
